# MultiModInstaller
A little installer for any Undertale/Deltarune Mod

Base of https://github.com/nkrapivin/SpaghettiInstaller

## TODO List

- Linux/Mac Port.
- Updater Mode (Basically the same has Applying but for an already installed mod)
- .Net6 Port.
- Xdelta3 has a c# (It makes the app more portable)
- Add support for Deltarune dectection.
- Change the way of how backups are handle (Override existing Installations is kinda mean...)
- Support for other UNDERTALE/DELTARUNE versions released on consoles with propper hash checksum
